=============================

![Banner DSS 2022 ](docs/img/bannerDSS2023.jpg)
## Context
Education faces significant challenges worldwide, particularly in underserved regions. Limited access to quality education, insufficient resources, and a shortage of qualified teachers hinder students' learning and future opportunities. Traditional teaching methods may not suit individual learning needs, leading to disengagement and lower academic outcomes. Additionally, AI's potential in education is limited due to the lack of localized and unbiased training data, affecting students from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Addressing these issues is crucial to create an equitable and inclusive learning environment, empowering all students to succeed in today's rapidly changing world.

## Objectives

The overall objective of this school is to highlight the benefits of using AI in education in order to enhance the quality of the learning experience and teaching material in different  languages. 
At the end of this school, the participants will be able to :
1. Explain the major innovative approaches around AI for a better education;
2. Identify the challenges of openly available, unbiased and localized training data for underrepresented cultures and languages;
3. Implement at least one use case on AI usage for :
    - Learning experience personalization (including students with special needs),
    - Learning outcomes prediction, 
    - Administrative workflows, 
    - Resource planning, 
    - Curriculum design.
    - Use AI-based approaches for spreading teaching materials to the largest in local languages seamlessly.
